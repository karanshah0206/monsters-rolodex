# Display & Filter Monster Profiles

My first React Project! I created this project to explore various React features.

This project allows you to view a range of monsters in the form of cards with their name, image, and email. You can filter monster profiles using the search bar.
It uses two APIs: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and https://robohash.org to fetch user data and monster images.
